\title{Geneva Affect Label Coder labeling function}
\usage{
GALC_Labeler(x, flagNotLabled = FALSE, sep = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{x:}{a string or a character vector}

\item{flagNotLabled:}{if true, prints out words that could not be labeled}

\item{sep:}{if given a value, x is treated as a list with sep separating each entry. Each entry will be checked on it's own. Helpful if x is a list of only emotion terms and it is important to know which words are ignored. Will still return a single list with Labeled terms and the not-labled terms}
}
\value{
A character string
}
\description{
Labels a character vector or string using the Geneva Affect Label Coder (GALC). Can be used either standalone with a character vector/string, outputting labels or with dplyr mutate to create a new column that is labeled as GALC. After labeling, the GALC_Reporter can create a report.
}
\examples{
x <- "I am really angry, but also sad"
